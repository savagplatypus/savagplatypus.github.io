Common Developer problems and how to resolve them
- PROBLEM: If for whatever reason you are waiting for a msdn or visual studio license to issue and the trial runs out you can follow the steps below to sign into a different account without having to uninstall/reinstall visual studio(x)

- From MSDN forums - since I had to hunt around far too much to find the solution to this:

- Close Visual Studio
- Start the Developer Command prompt installed with Visual Studio as an administrator.
- type 'devenv /resetuserdata' ('wdexpress /resetuserdata' for Express SKUs)
- Start Visual Studio Normally.

- This is the registry link for in this case Visual Studio 2013s profile location
- hkey_current_user\software\Microsoft\VSCommon\12.0\clientservices\tokenstorage\visualstudio\ideuser
